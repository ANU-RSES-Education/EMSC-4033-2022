## Flora and Fauna distribution map

## Executive summary

The distribution of organism is closely related to the geological environment. A simple map that contains both species distribution and geological pattern may give us a brief idea about where to find that organism and suggest correlation and interactions about them to some extent. It may also a good start point for us to study certain species. People can find a population and study relevant environmental factors.

In this project, I would use distribution data source and geological data from open online source and project them into the map.


## Goals

- Goal 1

The user can choose a region and a species of interest to check if there is any presence of the species in that region.
- Goal 2

The user can choose what organism features they want to look at, size, age and so on if available.
- Goal 3

The user can choose what geological features they want to add to the map
- Goal 4

The data can be clearly plotted on the map, different types of data would not blur together.


## Background and Innovation  

The distribution map for organisms is very common already, there are manty package available to build the distribution models. Most of these packages are used to investigate correlation between animals and environmental factors (rainfall, sunlight, nutrients and so on). The simple geological map is not so useful in that case, but it can give us a very clear view about where these animals might occur, and that could be a start point for many different research topics. Build a concise map that can help visualise both biological and geological features is my goal. Since I am very new to coding and my background is biology, this could be a suitable project to get start.

## Resources & Timeline

I would like to use API service from biological distribution data to access the existing data I need. I would first loop up several reliable databases that offer the API and diverse data.
I will try to look around if there are any existing package that I can adapt and add functionality to suit my purpose.
I would utilise the course materials and what we have learned so far to build an organism distribution map. (for example, Numpy and Cartopy packages)


## Testing, validation, documentation

First, I need to make sure my code returns expected data type and number of elements.
Then, go to the original database website to check if the data obtained by my code match the direct search and download.
